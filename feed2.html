	<h6>MetaCX has launched a Meta verse Business Value Network</h6>
    <p>
	Software firm MetaCX has launched the Business Value Network, a metaverse-based platform that lets businesses form “persistent digital connections” with other businesses in their ecosystem, according to a press release.

“Unlike traditional enterprise software that a company buys to automate internally-focused, transactional processes, the Business Value Network is a platform that companies join, as equals, to connect their externally-focused value chain,” the Indianapolis-based company said in the release.

MetaCX said the network is built around “a new computing paradigm broadly labeled as the metaverse,” adding in the release that it promises businesses collaboration through a single digital identity interoperable across all of a businesses’ relationships and technological investments.

“The evolution of B2B SaaS is reaching the end of its innovation cycle, and exciting new ideas are emerging that promise to connect businesses in powerful new ways,” said MetaCX Co-Founder and CEO Scott McCorkle in the release. “Where the last 20 years have seen steady progress on internally-focused, transactional automation across every business function, the next 20 years will bring externally-focused automation of the value chain — how one business creates value for another business, and then how value flows across entire ecosystems.”

The network establishes a secure and private space for members to “instrument any application, system, or digital endpoint,” the release stated.

MetaCX then turns this data into a real-time, comprehensive look at how companies are progressing toward expressing outcomes, allowing them to share that data with stakeholders throughout the business’ ecosystem, according to the release.

Companies can use the Business Value Network to improve collaboration with crucial customers, coordinating vendor efforts to reach key initiatives, and aligning an ecosystem around critical sustainability and diversity goals, the release stated.

More than 20 companies in the healthcare, technology, manufacturing, and government sectors have joined so far, according to the release.</p>
