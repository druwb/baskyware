<h3>Man Utd confirm Pogba departure as confidence grows of Juventus return</h3>
	<img style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%" width="80%" height="80%" src="img/ppb.jfif">
	<h6>The World Cup winner is set to move on to a new challenge after an underwhelming second spell at Old Trafford</h6>
    <p>Manchester United have confirmed that Paul Pogba will leave the club when his contract expires on June 30, with the midfielder closing in on a return to Juventus on a free transfer.

Pogba became the most expensive player in United's history when he re-signed for the club from Juve in an £89 million ($112m) deal back in 2016.

Unfortunately, the France international was unable to live up to that hefty price tag, and the Red Devils have decided against extending his contract after his latest underwhelming campaign.
United have said a final goodbye to Pogba in a statement on their official website, which reads: "The club can announce that Paul Pogba will leave Manchester United at the end of June, upon the expiry of his contract.

"Everyone at the club would like to congratulate Paul on his successful career, and thank him for his contributions to Manchester United.

"We wish him all the best for the next steps on a remarkable journey."
Pogba has been strongly linked with Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid, but GOAL has reported that Juve are leading the race to secure his services.

The Italian giants want to bring the 29-year-old back to Turin and have offered him a three-year deal worth €7.5 million (£6.3m/$7.9m) per season, but he has not yet made a final decision on his next move.</p>
